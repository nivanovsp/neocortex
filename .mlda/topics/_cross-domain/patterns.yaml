# Cross-Domain Patterns
# Patterns that span multiple domains
# Version: 1

# This file tracks patterns that emerge across domain boundaries.
# Use this when:
# - A pattern involves documents from 2+ domains
# - The pattern doesn't belong to any single domain
# - You need to document cross-cutting concerns

# Patterns spanning multiple domains
patterns:
  # Example pattern (remove when adding real patterns):
  # - name: "auth-rbac-bridge"
  #   domains:
  #     - authentication
  #     - rbac
  #   docs:
  #     - DOC-AUTH-008  # Identity claims
  #     - DOC-RBAC-001  # Role definitions
  #   description: "Authentication provides identity claims that RBAC uses for authorization"
  #   typical_tasks:
  #     - implementing
  #     - architecting
  #   frequency: 5

# Domain interaction matrix
# Documents which domains commonly interact
domain_interactions:
  # Example (remove when adding real data):
  # - domains: [authentication, rbac]
  #   frequency: high  # high | medium | low
  #   typical_direction: "authentication -> rbac"
  #   notes: "Auth always provides identity to RBAC, not reverse"

# Anti-patterns (cross-domain patterns that didn't work)
anti_patterns: []
  # Example:
  # - pattern: "Direct invoicing-to-auth dependency"
  #   reason: "Creates tight coupling between unrelated domains"
  #   discovered: "2026-01-15"
