summary: |
  Defines the Critical Thinking Protocol - an always-on cognitive substrate
  for AI agents. Implements four-layer model (Dispositions, Triggers, Standards,
  Metacognition), natural language confidence hedging, graduated disagreement
  response, and external verification requirements. Based on Paul-Elder framework
  and academic research on LLM calibration and self-correction limitations.
