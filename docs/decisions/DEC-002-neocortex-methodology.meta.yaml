summary: |
  Defines the Neocortex methodology - an evolution of RMS-BMAD that transforms
  how AI agents gather, process, and learn from documentation. Implements
  predictive context gathering, topic-based learning persistence, multi-agent
  scaling with recursive decomposition, six-layer verification stack, and
  token budget management with self-assessment. Based on Hawkins' Thousand
  Brains Theory, MIT's Recursive Language Models paper, and Claude Code 2.1.0
  capabilities.
