# Release Summary: v2.3.0 - Simplified Activation Protocol

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Version:** 2.3.0
**Codename:** DEC-JAN-26

---

## Executive Summary

This release introduces a **simplified activation protocol** that replaces DEC-009's `activation-context.yaml` approach. The new protocol reduces mode activation context from ~1900 lines to ~40 lines (~98% reduction) with native beads integration.

---

## Problem Solved

DEC-009 (activation-context.yaml) was deprecated because:
1. **Script execution unreliable** - Agents don't consistently execute PowerShell scripts
2. **Fallback defeated the purpose** - When file was missing, modes read full handoff.md (1400+ lines)
3. **Added complexity** - Another file to generate and maintain

## Solution Implemented

**DEC-JAN-26: Simplified Activation Protocol**

4-step mode activation:
1. Read `learning-index.yaml` (~30 lines) - know what topics exist
2. Check `bd ready --json` (~10 lines) - show pending tasks
3. Greet and await instructions
4. Load full docs **ON-DEMAND only** when task is selected

## Projects Deployed

| Project | Status |

| Ways of Development | Source (implemented here) |
| D:\dominaite | Deployed |
| D:\Dev Projects\Tasks app | Deployed |
| Invoice Module | Deployed |

## Context Savings

| Scenario | Before | After | Reduction |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Mode activation | ~1900 lines | ~40 lines | 98% |
| Files read on activation | 3-4 files | 1-2 files | 50-75% |
| Fallback complexity | High | None | 100% |

---

## Breaking Changes

None. The new activation protocol is backward compatible:
- If `learning-index.yaml` missing: note "MLDA not initialized", proceed
- If beads not initialized: skip silently
- Full functionality available, just won't have learning/task context

---

## Deprecations

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `.mlda/activation-context.yaml` | Deprecated - no longer generated or read |
| `mlda-generate-activation-context.ps1` | Deprecated - kept for reference |

---

## Testing Notes

To verify the new activation:
1. Start a new Claude Code session
2. Run `/modes:dev`
3. Observe: Should only read `learning-index.yaml` and run `bd ready`
4. Should NOT read `handoff.md` or `registry.yaml` until you select a task
